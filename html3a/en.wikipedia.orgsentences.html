It was established as a university through the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992 , and was formerly known as Lanchester Polytechnic until 1987 and Coventry Polytechnic until it was awarded university status. 
With more than 27,000 students (as of 2013), Coventry University is the larger of the two universities in the city, the other being the  University of Warwick . 
It has two campuses: one in the city centre of Coventry where a large majority of the university operates, and one in  London . 
The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a £160m redevelopment programme. [ 7 ]  The university comprises four faculties and one school, and manages a number of commercial subsidiaries that provide business services to local and national organisations. 
The university is a member of the  Association of Commonwealth Universities , [ 8 ]   University Alliance [ 9 ]  and  Universities UK .

Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the  Education Act 1902 . 
One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. [ 10 ] In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training in Coventry which the existing Coventry Technical College (now  City College Coventry ) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. 
Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after  Frederick Lanchester . [ 10 ] In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of  Rugby , amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. [ 11 ]  The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then  Education Secretary   Margaret Thatcher . [ 12 ]  The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity, notably when none of the contestants on the  BBC Radio 4  general knowledge show  Brain of Britain  could give its correct location. [ 13 ]  The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the  Birmingham pub bombings  in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. [ 14 ]  Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed "Coventry Polytechnic" in 1987, and when the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992  afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. 
In 2010, a campus in  London  was established to further attract international students to the university. [ 15 ]  In 2012 "Coventry University College" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. [ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] The Alan Berry building, opened in 1963 Priory Building. 
The building is used for Pre-Courses The Frederick Lanchester building housing the library first opened in September 2000 Built as a factory in the early 20th century, the William Morris building is now home to the university's Faculty of Business, Environment and Society The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences houses itself in the James Starley building, which dates back to the late 1950s The Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished for academic use in 2000 The Jaguar building, named for its automotive  sponsor , is the hub for Coventry's postgraduate students The Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty Built in 2012, the £55m Engineering and Computing building is the latest addition to Coventry's campus George Eliot. 
Language center and language studied classrooms Coventry campus [ edit ] Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built 33-acre (130,000 m 2 ) campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to  Coventry Cathedral  and the  Herbert Art Gallery and Museum . 
It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings,  converted structures , and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. 
The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building [ 17 ]  which opened in August 2011. 
The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by  Compass Group . [ 18 ]  In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale  Harrier jump jet , a wind tunnel and flight simulators. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  The Hub was awarded a  BREEAM  'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as  grey-water harvesting , a biomass boiler and a  green roof . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160m redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. [ 23 ] Coventry's £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. 
It was officially opened by  Princess Anne  in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000  monographs , and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. [ 24 ]  The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. [ 25 ] There are two converted buildings on the campus. 
A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the  Coventry Business School , and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the performing and media departments of the  Coventry School of Art and Design . [ 26 ] To the south of the main campus is the 20-acre (81,000 m 2 ) Coventry University Technology Park, a  business park  owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university. 
Tenants of the park are  small businesses  which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. [ 27 ]  The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, [ citation needed ]  and a digital lab for  serious game  and other technology development. [ 28 ] Coventry University College [ edit ] Coventry University College was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. 
In addition, the college recently began offering undergraduate BA degrees that can be completed entirely online. [ 29 ]  The college is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. [ 30 ]  Because the courses offered are part-time, tuition fees at the college are set at a maximum of £4,800, compared to the maximum £9,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. [ 31 ]  The part-time nature of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as early mornings, evenings and weekends. [ 16 ]  Although working within the Coventry University campus, students of the college do not have access to some of the university's resources, such as the sporting facilities. [ 32 ] Building names [ edit ] Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. 
These include former Coventry-based automotive company  Armstrong Siddeley ; Shakespearean actress  Ellen Terry ; Coventry-based automotive pioneer  Frederick Lanchester ; Victorian novelist, critic and poet  George Eliot ; the father of the bicycle industry  James Starley ; former MP for  Coventry East  and political journalist  Richard Crossman ; artist  Graham Sutherland ; and founder of the  Morris Motors  automotive manufacturer  William Morris . [ 26 ] London campus [ edit ] Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. [ 15 ]  The campus operates out of East India House, 109-117 Middlesex Street in the London borough of  Tower Hamlets , almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. 
Structure and organisation [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Sir John Egan. 
The Chancellor is supported by six  Pro-Chancellors  and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. [ 2 ]  Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. [ 2 ]  The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three  Pro Vice-Chancellors . [ 33 ]  The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. [ 3 ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Coventry is divided into three  faculties  and one school, each divided into different departments: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Coventry School of Art and Design Design and Visual Arts Media Performing Arts Industrial Design Faculty of Business, Environment and Society Coventry Business School English and Languages Geography, Environment and Disaster Management International Studies and Social Science Coventry Law School Faculty of Engineering and Computing Computing Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Mathematics and Physics Mechanical, Automotive and Manufacturing Engineering Aerospace, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Biomolecular and Sport Sciences Health Professions Nursing and Health Studies Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies Finances [ edit ] In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, Coventry University had a total income of £220.43 million and a total expenditure of £199.71 million. [ 1 ]  Key sources of income included £136.53 million from tuition fees and contracts, £45.18 million from funding body grants, £8.82 million in research grants and contracts, £1.96 million from investment and endowment income, and £27.92 million from other income. [ 1 ] Coventry University is an  exempt charity  under the Charities Act 1960. 
Commercial activities are undertaken by six subsidiaries wholly owned by the university. 
These subsidiaries are together known as the Coventry University Group, and deliver education, business support, partnership and consultancy, and serious game development to local and national organisations. [ 1 ] [ 38 ] Academic profile [ edit ] The Graham Sutherland building was built in 1959 and is used by the university's School of Art and Design Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as  foundation degrees  and  Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) . 
It has introduced the teaching of disaster management at undergraduate level (the first such course in the UK) [ 39 ]  as well as parapsychology [ 40 ]  and health journalism [ 41 ]  at the postgraduate level. 
The university's student body consists of 27,270 students: 22,020 undergraduates and 5,250 postgraduates. 
Part-time students make up 25% of undergraduates and 42% of postgraduates. [ 5 ]  The drop-out rate for first year undergraduates is 8.9% and the undergraduate intake from  state schools  is 97%. [ 42 ]  The university employs over 1,800 academic staff and is the fourth largest employer in Coventry. [ 43 ] Tuition fees  for undergraduate students at the university are variable and range from £7,500 to £9,000 depending on the degree programme, following the United Kingdom government’s  decision in 2010  to raise the maximum limit universities can charge UK and  EU  students. [ 44 ]  The university cited the variable fee structure in explaining the rise in applications received for 2012 compared to the previous year, despite an overall national fall. [ 45 ] Research [ edit ] The  Research Assessment Exercise  2008 classed that research conducted by the university in the subjects ‘Allied Health Professions and Studies’, ‘Computer Science and Informatics’, ‘Electrical and Electronic Engineering’, ‘Library and Information Management’, ‘Politics and International Studies’, ‘Social Work and Social Policy & Administration’, and ‘Art and Design’ contained elements of 'world-leading' research.

It was established as a university through the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992 , and was formerly known as Lanchester Polytechnic until 1987 and Coventry Polytechnic until it was awarded university status. 
With more than 27,000 students (as of 2013), Coventry University is the larger of the two universities in the city, the other being the  University of Warwick . 
It has two campuses: one in the city centre of Coventry where a large majority of the university operates, and one in  London . 
The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a £160m redevelopment programme. [ 7 ]  The university comprises four faculties and one school, and manages a number of commercial subsidiaries that provide business services to local and national organisations. 
The university is a member of the  Association of Commonwealth Universities , [ 8 ]   University Alliance [ 9 ]  and  Universities UK .

Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the  Education Act 1902 . 
One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. [ 10 ] In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training in Coventry which the existing Coventry Technical College (now  City College Coventry ) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. 
Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after  Frederick Lanchester . [ 10 ] In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of  Rugby , amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. [ 11 ]  The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then  Education Secretary   Margaret Thatcher . [ 12 ]  The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity, notably when none of the contestants on the  BBC Radio 4  general knowledge show  Brain of Britain  could give its correct location. [ 13 ]  The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the  Birmingham pub bombings  in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. [ 14 ]  Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed "Coventry Polytechnic" in 1987, and when the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992  afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. 
In 2010, a campus in  London  was established to further attract international students to the university. [ 15 ]  In 2012 "Coventry University College" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. [ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] The Alan Berry building, opened in 1963 Priory Building. 
The building is used for Pre-Courses The Frederick Lanchester building housing the library first opened in September 2000 Built as a factory in the early 20th century, the William Morris building is now home to the university's Faculty of Business, Environment and Society The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences houses itself in the James Starley building, which dates back to the late 1950s The Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished for academic use in 2000 The Jaguar building, named for its automotive  sponsor , is the hub for Coventry's postgraduate students The Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty Built in 2012, the £55m Engineering and Computing building is the latest addition to Coventry's campus George Eliot. 
Language center and language studied classrooms Coventry campus [ edit ] Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built 33-acre (130,000 m 2 ) campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to  Coventry Cathedral  and the  Herbert Art Gallery and Museum . 
It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings,  converted structures , and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. 
The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building [ 17 ]  which opened in August 2011. 
The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by  Compass Group . [ 18 ]  In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale  Harrier jump jet , a wind tunnel and flight simulators. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  The Hub was awarded a  BREEAM  'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as  grey-water harvesting , a biomass boiler and a  green roof . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160m redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. [ 23 ] Coventry's £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. 
It was officially opened by  Princess Anne  in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000  monographs , and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. [ 24 ]  The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. [ 25 ] There are two converted buildings on the campus. 
A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the  Coventry Business School , and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the performing and media departments of the  Coventry School of Art and Design . [ 26 ] To the south of the main campus is the 20-acre (81,000 m 2 ) Coventry University Technology Park, a  business park  owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university. 
Tenants of the park are  small businesses  which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. [ 27 ]  The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, [ citation needed ]  and a digital lab for  serious game  and other technology development. [ 28 ] Coventry University College [ edit ] Coventry University College was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. 
In addition, the college recently began offering undergraduate BA degrees that can be completed entirely online. [ 29 ]  The college is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. [ 30 ]  Because the courses offered are part-time, tuition fees at the college are set at a maximum of £4,800, compared to the maximum £9,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. [ 31 ]  The part-time nature of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as early mornings, evenings and weekends. [ 16 ]  Although working within the Coventry University campus, students of the college do not have access to some of the university's resources, such as the sporting facilities. [ 32 ] Building names [ edit ] Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. 
These include former Coventry-based automotive company  Armstrong Siddeley ; Shakespearean actress  Ellen Terry ; Coventry-based automotive pioneer  Frederick Lanchester ; Victorian novelist, critic and poet  George Eliot ; the father of the bicycle industry  James Starley ; former MP for  Coventry East  and political journalist  Richard Crossman ; artist  Graham Sutherland ; and founder of the  Morris Motors  automotive manufacturer  William Morris . [ 26 ] London campus [ edit ] Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. [ 15 ]  The campus operates out of East India House, 109-117 Middlesex Street in the London borough of  Tower Hamlets , almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. 
Structure and organisation [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Sir John Egan. 
The Chancellor is supported by six  Pro-Chancellors  and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. [ 2 ]  Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. [ 2 ]  The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three  Pro Vice-Chancellors . [ 33 ]  The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. [ 3 ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Coventry is divided into three  faculties  and one school, each divided into different departments: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Coventry School of Art and Design Design and Visual Arts Media Performing Arts Industrial Design Faculty of Business, Environment and Society Coventry Business School English and Languages Geography, Environment and Disaster Management International Studies and Social Science Coventry Law School Faculty of Engineering and Computing Computing Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Mathematics and Physics Mechanical, Automotive and Manufacturing Engineering Aerospace, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Biomolecular and Sport Sciences Health Professions Nursing and Health Studies Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies Finances [ edit ] In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, Coventry University had a total income of £220.43 million and a total expenditure of £199.71 million. [ 1 ]  Key sources of income included £136.53 million from tuition fees and contracts, £45.18 million from funding body grants, £8.82 million in research grants and contracts, £1.96 million from investment and endowment income, and £27.92 million from other income. [ 1 ] Coventry University is an  exempt charity  under the Charities Act 1960. 
Commercial activities are undertaken by six subsidiaries wholly owned by the university. 
These subsidiaries are together known as the Coventry University Group, and deliver education, business support, partnership and consultancy, and serious game development to local and national organisations. [ 1 ] [ 38 ] Academic profile [ edit ] The Graham Sutherland building was built in 1959 and is used by the university's School of Art and Design Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as  foundation degrees  and  Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) . 
It has introduced the teaching of disaster management at undergraduate level (the first such course in the UK) [ 39 ]  as well as parapsychology [ 40 ]  and health journalism [ 41 ]  at the postgraduate level. 
The university's student body consists of 27,270 students: 22,020 undergraduates and 5,250 postgraduates. 
Part-time students make up 25% of undergraduates and 42% of postgraduates. [ 5 ]  The drop-out rate for first year undergraduates is 8.9% and the undergraduate intake from  state schools  is 97%. [ 42 ]  The university employs over 1,800 academic staff and is the fourth largest employer in Coventry. [ 43 ] Tuition fees  for undergraduate students at the university are variable and range from £7,500 to £9,000 depending on the degree programme, following the United Kingdom government’s  decision in 2010  to raise the maximum limit universities can charge UK and  EU  students. [ 44 ]  The university cited the variable fee structure in explaining the rise in applications received for 2012 compared to the previous year, despite an overall national fall. [ 45 ] Research [ edit ] The  Research Assessment Exercise  2008 classed that research conducted by the university in the subjects ‘Allied Health Professions and Studies’, ‘Computer Science and Informatics’, ‘Electrical and Electronic Engineering’, ‘Library and Information Management’, ‘Politics and International Studies’, ‘Social Work and Social Policy & Administration’, and ‘Art and Design’ contained elements of 'world-leading' research.

It was established as a university through the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992 , and was formerly known as Lanchester Polytechnic until 1987 and Coventry Polytechnic until it was awarded university status. 
With more than 27,000 students (as of 2013), Coventry University is the larger of the two universities in the city, the other being the  University of Warwick . 
It has two campuses: one in the city centre of Coventry where a large majority of the university operates, and one in  London . 
The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a £160m redevelopment programme. [ 7 ]  The university comprises four faculties and one school, and manages a number of commercial subsidiaries that provide business services to local and national organisations. 
The university is a member of the  Association of Commonwealth Universities , [ 8 ]   University Alliance [ 9 ]  and  Universities UK .

Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the  Education Act 1902 . 
One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. [ 10 ] In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training in Coventry which the existing Coventry Technical College (now  City College Coventry ) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. 
Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after  Frederick Lanchester . [ 10 ] In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of  Rugby , amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. [ 11 ]  The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then  Education Secretary   Margaret Thatcher . [ 12 ]  The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity, notably when none of the contestants on the  BBC Radio 4  general knowledge show  Brain of Britain  could give its correct location. [ 13 ]  The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the  Birmingham pub bombings  in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. [ 14 ]  Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed "Coventry Polytechnic" in 1987, and when the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992  afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. 
In 2010, a campus in  London  was established to further attract international students to the university. [ 15 ]  In 2012 "Coventry University College" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. [ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] The Alan Berry building, opened in 1963 Priory Building. 
The building is used for Pre-Courses The Frederick Lanchester building housing the library first opened in September 2000 Built as a factory in the early 20th century, the William Morris building is now home to the university's Faculty of Business, Environment and Society The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences houses itself in the James Starley building, which dates back to the late 1950s The Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished for academic use in 2000 The Jaguar building, named for its automotive  sponsor , is the hub for Coventry's postgraduate students The Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty Built in 2012, the £55m Engineering and Computing building is the latest addition to Coventry's campus George Eliot. 
Language center and language studied classrooms Coventry campus [ edit ] Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built 33-acre (130,000 m 2 ) campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to  Coventry Cathedral  and the  Herbert Art Gallery and Museum . 
It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings,  converted structures , and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. 
The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building [ 17 ]  which opened in August 2011. 
The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by  Compass Group . [ 18 ]  In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale  Harrier jump jet , a wind tunnel and flight simulators. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  The Hub was awarded a  BREEAM  'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as  grey-water harvesting , a biomass boiler and a  green roof . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160m redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. [ 23 ] Coventry's £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. 
It was officially opened by  Princess Anne  in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000  monographs , and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. [ 24 ]  The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. [ 25 ] There are two converted buildings on the campus. 
A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the  Coventry Business School , and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the performing and media departments of the  Coventry School of Art and Design . [ 26 ] To the south of the main campus is the 20-acre (81,000 m 2 ) Coventry University Technology Park, a  business park  owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university. 
Tenants of the park are  small businesses  which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. [ 27 ]  The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, [ citation needed ]  and a digital lab for  serious game  and other technology development. [ 28 ] Coventry University College [ edit ] Coventry University College was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. 
In addition, the college recently began offering undergraduate BA degrees that can be completed entirely online. [ 29 ]  The college is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. [ 30 ]  Because the courses offered are part-time, tuition fees at the college are set at a maximum of £4,800, compared to the maximum £9,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. [ 31 ]  The part-time nature of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as early mornings, evenings and weekends. [ 16 ]  Although working within the Coventry University campus, students of the college do not have access to some of the university's resources, such as the sporting facilities. [ 32 ] Building names [ edit ] Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. 
These include former Coventry-based automotive company  Armstrong Siddeley ; Shakespearean actress  Ellen Terry ; Coventry-based automotive pioneer  Frederick Lanchester ; Victorian novelist, critic and poet  George Eliot ; the father of the bicycle industry  James Starley ; former MP for  Coventry East  and political journalist  Richard Crossman ; artist  Graham Sutherland ; and founder of the  Morris Motors  automotive manufacturer  William Morris . [ 26 ] London campus [ edit ] Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. [ 15 ]  The campus operates out of East India House, 109-117 Middlesex Street in the London borough of  Tower Hamlets , almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. 
Structure and organisation [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Sir John Egan. 
The Chancellor is supported by six  Pro-Chancellors  and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. [ 2 ]  Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. [ 2 ]  The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three  Pro Vice-Chancellors . [ 33 ]  The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. [ 3 ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Coventry is divided into three  faculties  and one school, each divided into different departments: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Coventry School of Art and Design Design and Visual Arts Media Performing Arts Industrial Design Faculty of Business, Environment and Society Coventry Business School English and Languages Geography, Environment and Disaster Management International Studies and Social Science Coventry Law School Faculty of Engineering and Computing Computing Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Mathematics and Physics Mechanical, Automotive and Manufacturing Engineering Aerospace, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Biomolecular and Sport Sciences Health Professions Nursing and Health Studies Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies Finances [ edit ] In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, Coventry University had a total income of £220.43 million and a total expenditure of £199.71 million. [ 1 ]  Key sources of income included £136.53 million from tuition fees and contracts, £45.18 million from funding body grants, £8.82 million in research grants and contracts, £1.96 million from investment and endowment income, and £27.92 million from other income. [ 1 ] Coventry University is an  exempt charity  under the Charities Act 1960.

It has two campuses: one in the city centre of Coventry where a large majority of the university operates, and one in  London . 
The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a £160m redevelopment programme. [ 7 ]  The university comprises four faculties and one school, and manages a number of commercial subsidiaries that provide business services to local and national organisations. 
The university is a member of the  Association of Commonwealth Universities , [ 8 ]   University Alliance [ 9 ]  and  Universities UK .

Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the  Education Act 1902 . 
One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. [ 10 ] In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training in Coventry which the existing Coventry Technical College (now  City College Coventry ) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. 
Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after  Frederick Lanchester . [ 10 ] In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of  Rugby , amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. [ 11 ]  The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then  Education Secretary   Margaret Thatcher . [ 12 ]  The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity, notably when none of the contestants on the  BBC Radio 4  general knowledge show  Brain of Britain  could give its correct location. [ 13 ]  The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the  Birmingham pub bombings  in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. [ 14 ]  Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed "Coventry Polytechnic" in 1987, and when the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992  afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. 
In 2010, a campus in  London  was established to further attract international students to the university. [ 15 ]  In 2012 "Coventry University College" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. [ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] The Alan Berry building, opened in 1963 Priory Building. 
The building is used for Pre-Courses The Frederick Lanchester building housing the library first opened in September 2000 Built as a factory in the early 20th century, the William Morris building is now home to the university's Faculty of Business, Environment and Society The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences houses itself in the James Starley building, which dates back to the late 1950s The Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished for academic use in 2000 The Jaguar building, named for its automotive  sponsor , is the hub for Coventry's postgraduate students The Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty Built in 2012, the £55m Engineering and Computing building is the latest addition to Coventry's campus George Eliot. 
Language center and language studied classrooms Coventry campus [ edit ] Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built 33-acre (130,000 m 2 ) campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to  Coventry Cathedral  and the  Herbert Art Gallery and Museum . 
It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings,  converted structures , and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. 
The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building [ 17 ]  which opened in August 2011. 
The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by  Compass Group . [ 18 ]  In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale  Harrier jump jet , a wind tunnel and flight simulators. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  The Hub was awarded a  BREEAM  'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as  grey-water harvesting , a biomass boiler and a  green roof . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160m redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. [ 23 ] Coventry's £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. 
It was officially opened by  Princess Anne  in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000  monographs , and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. [ 24 ]  The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. [ 25 ] There are two converted buildings on the campus. 
A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the  Coventry Business School , and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the performing and media departments of the  Coventry School of Art and Design . [ 26 ] To the south of the main campus is the 20-acre (81,000 m 2 ) Coventry University Technology Park, a  business park  owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university. 
Tenants of the park are  small businesses  which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. [ 27 ]  The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, [ citation needed ]  and a digital lab for  serious game  and other technology development. [ 28 ] Coventry University College [ edit ] Coventry University College was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. 
In addition, the college recently began offering undergraduate BA degrees that can be completed entirely online. [ 29 ]  The college is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. [ 30 ]  Because the courses offered are part-time, tuition fees at the college are set at a maximum of £4,800, compared to the maximum £9,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. [ 31 ]  The part-time nature of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as early mornings, evenings and weekends. [ 16 ]  Although working within the Coventry University campus, students of the college do not have access to some of the university's resources, such as the sporting facilities. [ 32 ] Building names [ edit ] Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. 
These include former Coventry-based automotive company  Armstrong Siddeley ; Shakespearean actress  Ellen Terry ; Coventry-based automotive pioneer  Frederick Lanchester ; Victorian novelist, critic and poet  George Eliot ; the father of the bicycle industry  James Starley ; former MP for  Coventry East  and political journalist  Richard Crossman ; artist  Graham Sutherland ; and founder of the  Morris Motors  automotive manufacturer  William Morris . [ 26 ] London campus [ edit ] Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. [ 15 ]  The campus operates out of East India House, 109-117 Middlesex Street in the London borough of  Tower Hamlets , almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. 
Structure and organisation [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Sir John Egan. 
The Chancellor is supported by six  Pro-Chancellors  and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. [ 2 ]  Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. [ 2 ]  The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three  Pro Vice-Chancellors . [ 33 ]  The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. [ 3 ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Coventry is divided into three  faculties  and one school, each divided into different departments: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Coventry School of Art and Design Design and Visual Arts Media Performing Arts Industrial Design Faculty of Business, Environment and Society Coventry Business School English and Languages Geography, Environment and Disaster Management International Studies and Social Science Coventry Law School Faculty of Engineering and Computing Computing Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Mathematics and Physics Mechanical, Automotive and Manufacturing Engineering Aerospace, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Biomolecular and Sport Sciences Health Professions Nursing and Health Studies Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies Finances [ edit ] In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, Coventry University had a total income of £220.43 million and a total expenditure of £199.71 million. [ 1 ]  Key sources of income included £136.53 million from tuition fees and contracts, £45.18 million from funding body grants, £8.82 million in research grants and contracts, £1.96 million from investment and endowment income, and £27.92 million from other income. [ 1 ] Coventry University is an  exempt charity  under the Charities Act 1960. 
Commercial activities are undertaken by six subsidiaries wholly owned by the university. 
These subsidiaries are together known as the Coventry University Group, and deliver education, business support, partnership and consultancy, and serious game development to local and national organisations. [ 1 ] [ 38 ] Academic profile [ edit ] The Graham Sutherland building was built in 1959 and is used by the university's School of Art and Design Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as  foundation degrees  and  Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) . 
It has introduced the teaching of disaster management at undergraduate level (the first such course in the UK) [ 39 ]  as well as parapsychology [ 40 ]  and health journalism [ 41 ]  at the postgraduate level. 
The university's student body consists of 27,270 students: 22,020 undergraduates and 5,250 postgraduates. 
Part-time students make up 25% of undergraduates and 42% of postgraduates. [ 5 ]  The drop-out rate for first year undergraduates is 8.9% and the undergraduate intake from  state schools  is 97%. [ 42 ]  The university employs over 1,800 academic staff and is the fourth largest employer in Coventry. [ 43 ] Tuition fees  for undergraduate students at the university are variable and range from £7,500 to £9,000 depending on the degree programme, following the United Kingdom government’s  decision in 2010  to raise the maximum limit universities can charge UK and  EU  students. [ 44 ]  The university cited the variable fee structure in explaining the rise in applications received for 2012 compared to the previous year, despite an overall national fall. [ 45 ] Research [ edit ] The  Research Assessment Exercise  2008 classed that research conducted by the university in the subjects ‘Allied Health Professions and Studies’, ‘Computer Science and Informatics’, ‘Electrical and Electronic Engineering’, ‘Library and Information Management’, ‘Politics and International Studies’, ‘Social Work and Social Policy & Administration’, and ‘Art and Design’ contained elements of 'world-leading' research.

It was established as a university through the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992 , and was formerly known as Lanchester Polytechnic until 1987 and Coventry Polytechnic until it was awarded university status. 
With more than 27,000 students (as of 2013), Coventry University is the larger of the two universities in the city, the other being the  University of Warwick . 
It has two campuses: one in the city centre of Coventry where a large majority of the university operates, and one in  London . 
The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a £160m redevelopment programme. [ 7 ]  The university comprises four faculties and one school, and manages a number of commercial subsidiaries that provide business services to local and national organisations. 
The university is a member of the  Association of Commonwealth Universities , [ 8 ]   University Alliance [ 9 ]  and  Universities UK .

Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the  Education Act 1902 . 
One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. [ 10 ] In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training in Coventry which the existing Coventry Technical College (now  City College Coventry ) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. 
Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after  Frederick Lanchester . [ 10 ] In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of  Rugby , amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. [ 11 ]  The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then  Education Secretary   Margaret Thatcher . [ 12 ]  The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity, notably when none of the contestants on the  BBC Radio 4  general knowledge show  Brain of Britain  could give its correct location. [ 13 ]  The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the  Birmingham pub bombings  in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. [ 14 ]  Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed "Coventry Polytechnic" in 1987, and when the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992  afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. 
In 2010, a campus in  London  was established to further attract international students to the university. [ 15 ]  In 2012 "Coventry University College" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. [ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] The Alan Berry building, opened in 1963 Priory Building. 
The building is used for Pre-Courses The Frederick Lanchester building housing the library first opened in September 2000 Built as a factory in the early 20th century, the William Morris building is now home to the university's Faculty of Business, Environment and Society The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences houses itself in the James Starley building, which dates back to the late 1950s The Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished for academic use in 2000 The Jaguar building, named for its automotive  sponsor , is the hub for Coventry's postgraduate students The Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty Built in 2012, the £55m Engineering and Computing building is the latest addition to Coventry's campus George Eliot. 
Language center and language studied classrooms Coventry campus [ edit ] Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built 33-acre (130,000 m 2 ) campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to  Coventry Cathedral  and the  Herbert Art Gallery and Museum . 
It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings,  converted structures , and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. 
The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building [ 17 ]  which opened in August 2011. 
The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by  Compass Group . [ 18 ]  In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale  Harrier jump jet , a wind tunnel and flight simulators. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  The Hub was awarded a  BREEAM  'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as  grey-water harvesting , a biomass boiler and a  green roof . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160m redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. [ 23 ] Coventry's £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. 
It was officially opened by  Princess Anne  in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000  monographs , and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. [ 24 ]  The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. [ 25 ] There are two converted buildings on the campus. 
A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the  Coventry Business School , and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the performing and media departments of the  Coventry School of Art and Design . [ 26 ] To the south of the main campus is the 20-acre (81,000 m 2 ) Coventry University Technology Park, a  business park  owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university. 
Tenants of the park are  small businesses  which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. [ 27 ]  The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, [ citation needed ]  and a digital lab for  serious game  and other technology development. [ 28 ] Coventry University College [ edit ] Coventry University College was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. 
In addition, the college recently began offering undergraduate BA degrees that can be completed entirely online. [ 29 ]  The college is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. [ 30 ]  Because the courses offered are part-time, tuition fees at the college are set at a maximum of £4,800, compared to the maximum £9,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. [ 31 ]  The part-time nature of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as early mornings, evenings and weekends. [ 16 ]  Although working within the Coventry University campus, students of the college do not have access to some of the university's resources, such as the sporting facilities. [ 32 ] Building names [ edit ] Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. 
These include former Coventry-based automotive company  Armstrong Siddeley ; Shakespearean actress  Ellen Terry ; Coventry-based automotive pioneer  Frederick Lanchester ; Victorian novelist, critic and poet  George Eliot ; the father of the bicycle industry  James Starley ; former MP for  Coventry East  and political journalist  Richard Crossman ; artist  Graham Sutherland ; and founder of the  Morris Motors  automotive manufacturer  William Morris . [ 26 ] London campus [ edit ] Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. [ 15 ]  The campus operates out of East India House, 109-117 Middlesex Street in the London borough of  Tower Hamlets , almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. 
Structure and organisation [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Sir John Egan. 
The Chancellor is supported by six  Pro-Chancellors  and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. [ 2 ]  Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. [ 2 ]  The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three  Pro Vice-Chancellors . [ 33 ]  The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. [ 3 ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Coventry is divided into three  faculties  and one school, each divided into different departments: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Coventry School of Art and Design Design and Visual Arts Media Performing Arts Industrial Design Faculty of Business, Environment and Society Coventry Business School English and Languages Geography, Environment and Disaster Management International Studies and Social Science Coventry Law School Faculty of Engineering and Computing Computing Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Mathematics and Physics Mechanical, Automotive and Manufacturing Engineering Aerospace, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Biomolecular and Sport Sciences Health Professions Nursing and Health Studies Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies Finances [ edit ] In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, Coventry University had a total income of £220.43 million and a total expenditure of £199.71 million. [ 1 ]  Key sources of income included £136.53 million from tuition fees and contracts, £45.18 million from funding body grants, £8.82 million in research grants and contracts, £1.96 million from investment and endowment income, and £27.92 million from other income. [ 1 ] Coventry University is an  exempt charity  under the Charities Act 1960. 
Commercial activities are undertaken by six subsidiaries wholly owned by the university. 
These subsidiaries are together known as the Coventry University Group, and deliver education, business support, partnership and consultancy, and serious game development to local and national organisations. [ 1 ] [ 38 ] Academic profile [ edit ] The Graham Sutherland building was built in 1959 and is used by the university's School of Art and Design Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as  foundation degrees  and  Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) . 
It has introduced the teaching of disaster management at undergraduate level (the first such course in the UK) [ 39 ]  as well as parapsychology [ 40 ]  and health journalism [ 41 ]  at the postgraduate level. 
The university's student body consists of 27,270 students: 22,020 undergraduates and 5,250 postgraduates. 
Part-time students make up 25% of undergraduates and 42% of postgraduates. [ 5 ]  The drop-out rate for first year undergraduates is 8.9% and the undergraduate intake from  state schools  is 97%. [ 42 ]  The university employs over 1,800 academic staff and is the fourth largest employer in Coventry. [ 43 ] Tuition fees  for undergraduate students at the university are variable and range from £7,500 to £9,000 depending on the degree programme, following the United Kingdom government’s  decision in 2010  to raise the maximum limit universities can charge UK and  EU  students. [ 44 ]  The university cited the variable fee structure in explaining the rise in applications received for 2012 compared to the previous year, despite an overall national fall. [ 45 ] Research [ edit ] The  Research Assessment Exercise  2008 classed that research conducted by the university in the subjects ‘Allied Health Professions and Studies’, ‘Computer Science and Informatics’, ‘Electrical and Electronic Engineering’, ‘Library and Information Management’, ‘Politics and International Studies’, ‘Social Work and Social Policy & Administration’, and ‘Art and Design’ contained elements of 'world-leading' research.

It was established as a university through the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992 , and was formerly known as Lanchester Polytechnic until 1987 and Coventry Polytechnic until it was awarded university status. 
With more than 27,000 students (as of 2013), Coventry University is the larger of the two universities in the city, the other being the  University of Warwick . 
It has two campuses: one in the city centre of Coventry where a large majority of the university operates, and one in  London . 
The campus in Coventry is currently undergoing a £160m redevelopment programme. [ 7 ]  The university comprises four faculties and one school, and manages a number of commercial subsidiaries that provide business services to local and national organisations. 
The university is a member of the  Association of Commonwealth Universities , [ 8 ]   University Alliance [ 9 ]  and  Universities UK .

Later renamed the Coventry School of Art, it was again renamed in the early 20th century to the Municipal Art School as part of the  Education Act 1902 . 
One final name change took place in the 1950s, when it became known as the College of Art. [ 10 ] In the late 1950s, to address the need for a high level of technical training in Coventry which the existing Coventry Technical College (now  City College Coventry ) could not meet, the construction of a new institution began. 
Opened in 1961, it was called the Lanchester College of Technology, named after  Frederick Lanchester . [ 10 ] In 1970, the Lanchester College of Technology and the College of Art, along with the Rugby College of Engineering Technology in the neighbouring town of  Rugby , amalgamated to form Lanchester Polytechnic. [ 11 ]  The institution was designated as such in February 1971 by then  Education Secretary   Margaret Thatcher . [ 12 ]  The name Lanchester gave the institution a certain degree of obscurity, notably when none of the contestants on the  BBC Radio 4  general knowledge show  Brain of Britain  could give its correct location. [ 13 ]  The polytechnic cancelled its graduation ceremony in 1974 following the  Birmingham pub bombings  in fear that public gatherings could be targeted; the ceremony was eventually held in 2009, 35 years later. [ 14 ]  Lanchester Polytechnic was later renamed "Coventry Polytechnic" in 1987, and when the  Further and Higher Education Act 1992  afforded Coventry Polytechnic university status that year, the name was changed to Coventry University. 
In 2010, a campus in  London  was established to further attract international students to the university. [ 15 ]  In 2012 "Coventry University College" was set up within the main university campus, offering qualifications up to degree-level at a lower cost compared to typical university fees. [ 16 ] Campus [ edit ] The Alan Berry building, opened in 1963 Priory Building. 
The building is used for Pre-Courses The Frederick Lanchester building housing the library first opened in September 2000 Built as a factory in the early 20th century, the William Morris building is now home to the university's Faculty of Business, Environment and Society The Faculty of Health and Life Sciences houses itself in the James Starley building, which dates back to the late 1950s The Ellen Terry building is a former 20th century cinema that was refurbished for academic use in 2000 The Jaguar building, named for its automotive  sponsor , is the hub for Coventry's postgraduate students The Graham Sutherland building is main building for Art and Design faculty Built in 2012, the £55m Engineering and Computing building is the latest addition to Coventry's campus George Eliot. 
Language center and language studied classrooms Coventry campus [ edit ] Coventry currently occupies a purpose-built 33-acre (130,000 m 2 ) campus in Coventry City Centre adjacent to  Coventry Cathedral  and the  Herbert Art Gallery and Museum . 
It occupies a mix of new purpose-built buildings,  converted structures , and those inherited from its predecessor institutions. 
The centrepiece of the campus is The Hub, an award-winning building [ 17 ]  which opened in August 2011. 
The Hub is the home of the Coventry University Students’ Union, student support services, a bar/nightclub, a food hall and food outlets which are catered by  Compass Group . [ 18 ]  In September 2012, a new £55 million engineering building was opened, with facilities such as a full-scale  Harrier jump jet , a wind tunnel and flight simulators. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]  The Hub was awarded a  BREEAM  'excellent' rating and between them The Hub and the engineering building feature sustainable initiatives such as  grey-water harvesting , a biomass boiler and a  green roof . [ 21 ] [ 22 ]  The opening of the buildings marks the first stage of a £160m redevelopment plan of the campus phased over 15 years. [ 23 ] Coventry's £20 million library opened in 2000 and is on the outskirts of the campus. 
It was officially opened by  Princess Anne  in September 2001 and contains over 2,000 print periodicals, 350,000  monographs , and more than 6,000 video tapes, audio tapes and films. [ 24 ]  The library has a distinctive turreted exterior and has won awards for its interior design which features a light distribution system to make the most of natural light throughout the building. [ 25 ] There are two converted buildings on the campus. 
A former car engine factory built in 1910 located next to the university's library now houses the  Coventry Business School , and a cinema built in 1880 on Jordan Well is currently home to the performing and media departments of the  Coventry School of Art and Design . [ 26 ] To the south of the main campus is the 20-acre (81,000 m 2 ) Coventry University Technology Park, a  business park  owned by Coventry University Enterprises Limited, a commercial subsidiary of the university. 
Tenants of the park are  small businesses  which receive support from the university and are allowed access to the university's library. [ 27 ]  The park is also home to conference facilities at the TechnoCentre building, the Coventry and Warwickshire New Technology Institute, which works with companies to address skills shortages in ICT and advanced technology, [ citation needed ]  and a digital lab for  serious game  and other technology development. [ 28 ] Coventry University College [ edit ] Coventry University College was established on campus in 2012 and is an offshoot of Coventry University, providing part-time professional courses such as accounting, legal studies and marketing. 
In addition, the college recently began offering undergraduate BA degrees that can be completed entirely online. [ 29 ]  The college is independent from the university with its own staff and facilities, though its programmes are validated and awarded by the university. [ 30 ]  Because the courses offered are part-time, tuition fees at the college are set at a maximum of £4,800, compared to the maximum £9,000 universities in the UK can charge for full-time courses. [ 31 ]  The part-time nature of the courses delivered means classes can run at atypical times, such as early mornings, evenings and weekends. [ 16 ]  Although working within the Coventry University campus, students of the college do not have access to some of the university's resources, such as the sporting facilities. [ 32 ] Building names [ edit ] Coventry has adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. 
These include former Coventry-based automotive company  Armstrong Siddeley ; Shakespearean actress  Ellen Terry ; Coventry-based automotive pioneer  Frederick Lanchester ; Victorian novelist, critic and poet  George Eliot ; the father of the bicycle industry  James Starley ; former MP for  Coventry East  and political journalist  Richard Crossman ; artist  Graham Sutherland ; and founder of the  Morris Motors  automotive manufacturer  William Morris . [ 26 ] London campus [ edit ] Coventry University's London campus was opened in 2010 as part of a trend seen by a number of different British universities, where a campus in London was set up with a predominately international student body to build the universities' international reputation. [ 15 ]  The campus operates out of East India House, 109-117 Middlesex Street in the London borough of  Tower Hamlets , almost 100 miles southeast of Coventry. 
Scarborough campus [ edit ] The University will open a new facility in  Scarborough, North Yorkshire , as from 2015, and is to be part of a completely new £45million development, in the Weaponess area of the town, in 2016. 
The University is to contribute £12million towards the project. 
Courses will include Law, Science & Engineering. 
The site will also incorporate a University Technical College (UTC), for 14-18 year olds. 
Structure and organisation [ edit ] Governance [ edit ] Coventry University is headed formally by the Chancellor, a largely ceremonial role, currently Sir John Egan. 
The Chancellor is supported by six  Pro-Chancellors  and is appointed by the university's Board of Governors. [ 2 ]  Terms for the Chancellor and Pro-Chancellors are five years in length; the number of terms a Chancellor can serve is unrestricted while Pro-Chancellors are limited to two. [ 2 ]  The university is led on a day-to-day basis by the Vice-Chancellor, who is supported by four Deputy Vice-Chancellors and three  Pro Vice-Chancellors . [ 33 ]  The position of Vice-Chancellor has been occupied by John Latham since March 2014. [ 3 ] Faculties and schools [ edit ] Coventry is divided into three  faculties  and one school, each divided into different departments: [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Coventry School of Art and Design Design and Visual Arts Media Performing Arts Industrial Design Faculty of Business, Environment and Society Coventry Business School English and Languages Geography, Environment and Disaster Management International Studies and Social Science Coventry Law School Faculty of Engineering and Computing Computing Civil Engineering, Architecture and Building Mathematics and Physics Mechanical, Automotive and Manufacturing Engineering Aerospace, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Faculty of Health and Life Sciences Biomolecular and Sport Sciences Health Professions Nursing and Health Studies Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Social, Therapeutic and Community Studies Finances [ edit ] In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, Coventry University had a total income of £220.43 million and a total expenditure of £199.71 million. [ 1 ]  Key sources of income included £136.53 million from tuition fees and contracts, £45.18 million from funding body grants, £8.82 million in research grants and contracts, £1.96 million from investment and endowment income, and £27.92 million from other income. [ 1 ] Coventry University is an  exempt charity  under the Charities Act 1960. 
Commercial activities are undertaken by six subsidiaries wholly owned by the university. 
These subsidiaries are together known as the Coventry University Group, and deliver education, business support, partnership and consultancy, and serious game development to local and national organisations. [ 1 ] [ 38 ] Academic profile [ edit ] The Graham Sutherland building was built in 1959 and is used by the university's School of Art and Design Coventry offers more than 130 undergraduate degrees and 100 postgraduate degrees over its four faculties, as well as qualifications such as  foundation degrees  and  Higher National Diplomas (HNDs) .
