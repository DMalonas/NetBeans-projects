Cybernetics  is a  transdisciplinary [ 1 ]  approach for exploring regulatory  systems , their  structures , constraints, and possibilities. 
In fact, today the name is often used in a rather loose way to imply "control of any system using technology", and this has blunted its meaning to such an extent that many writers avoid using it. 
Cybernetics is relevant to the study of systems, such as mechanical, physical, biological, cognitive, and  social systems . 
Cybernetics is applicable when a system being analyzed incorporates a closed signaling loop; that is, where action by the system generates some change in its environment and that change is reflected in that system in some manner ( feedback ) that triggers a system change, originally referred to as a "circular causal" relationship. 
Some say [ citation needed ]  this is necessary to a cybernetic perspective. 
System dynamics , a related field, originated with applications of  electrical engineering   control theory  to other kinds of  simulation models  (especially business systems) by  Jay Forrester  at  MIT  in the 1950s. 
Concepts studied by  cyberneticists  include, but are not limited to:  learning ,  cognition ,  adaptation ,  social control ,  emergence ,  communication ,  efficiency ,  efficacy , and  connectivity . 
These concepts are studied by other subjects such as  engineering  and  biology , but in cybernetics these are abstracted from the context of the individual  organism  or  device . 
Norbert Wiener  defined cybernetics in 1948 as "the scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine." [ 2 ]  The word  cybernetics  comes from  Greek  κυβερνητική ( kybernetike ), meaning "governance", i.e., all that are pertinent to κυβερνάω ( kybernao ), the latter meaning "to steer, navigate or govern", hence κυβέρνησις ( kybernesis ), meaning "government", is the government while κυβερνήτης ( kybernetes ) is the governor or the captain. 
Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems,  electrical network theory ,  mechanical engineering ,  logic modeling ,  evolutionary biology ,  neuroscience ,  anthropology , and  psychology  in the 1940s, often attributed to the  Macy Conferences . 
During the second half of the 20th century cybernetics evolved in ways that distinguish first-order cybernetics (about observed systems) from second-order cybernetics (about observing systems). [ 3 ]  More recently there is talk about a third-order cybernetics (doing in ways that embraces first and second-order). [ 4 ] Fields of study which have influenced or been influenced by cybernetics include  game theory ,  system theory  (a mathematical counterpart to cybernetics),  perceptual control theory ,  sociology , psychology (especially  neuropsychology ,  behavioral psychology ,  cognitive psychology ),  philosophy ,  architecture , and  organizational theory .

AB < 0 for  negative feedback . 
The term  cybernetics  stems from  κυβερνήτης  ( kybernētēs ) "steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder" (the same root as  government ). 
As with the ancient Greek pilot, independence of thought is important in cybernetics. [ 8 ]  Cybernetics is a broad field of study, but the essential goal of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular,  causal chains  that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal, and again to action. 
Studies in cybernetics provide a means for examining the design and function of any system, including social systems such as business management and organizational learning, including for the purpose of making them more  efficient  and  effective . 
French physicist and mathematician  André-Marie Ampère  first coined the word "cybernetique" in his 1834 essay  Essai sur la philosophie des sciences  to describe the science of civil government. [ 9 ] Cybernetics was borrowed by  Norbert Wiener , in his book  "Cybernetics" , to define the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine. [ 10 ]   Stafford Beer  called it the science of effective organization and  Gordon Pask  called it "the art of defensible metaphors" (emphasizing its constructivist epistemology) though he later extended it to include information flows "in all media" from stars to brains. 
It includes the study of  feedback ,  black boxes  and derived concepts such as  communication  and  control  in  living organisms ,  machines  and  organizations  including  self-organization . 
Its focus is how anything (digital, mechanical or biological) processes information, reacts to information, and changes or can be changed to better accomplish the first two tasks. [ 11 ]  A more philosophical definition, suggested in 1956 by  Louis Couffignal , one of the pioneers of cybernetics, characterizes cybernetics as "the art of ensuring the efficacy of action." [ 12 ]  The most recent definition has been proposed by  Louis Kauffman , President of the  American Society for Cybernetics , "Cybernetics is the study of systems and processes that interact with themselves and produce themselves from themselves." [ 13 ] History [ edit ] The roots of cybernetic theory [ edit ] The word  cybernetics  was first used in the context of "the study of self-governance" by  Plato  in  The Alcibiades  to signify the  governance  of people. [ 14 ]  The word 'cybernétique' was also used in 1834 by the physicist  André-Marie Ampère  (1775–1836) to denote the sciences of government in his classification system of human knowledge. 
James Watt The first artificial automatic regulatory system, a  water clock , was invented by the mechanician  Ktesibios . 
In his water clocks, water flowed from a source such as a holding tank into a reservoir, then from the reservoir to the mechanisms of the clock. 
Ktesibios's device used a cone-shaped float to monitor the level of the water in its reservoir and adjust the rate of flow of the water accordingly to maintain a constant level of water in the reservoir, so that it neither overflowed nor was allowed to run dry. 
This was the first artificial truly automatic self-regulatory device that required no outside intervention between the feedback and the controls of the mechanism. 
Although they did not refer to this concept by the name of Cybernetics (they considered it a field of engineering),  Ktesibios  and others such as  Heron  and  Su Song  are considered to be some of the first to study cybernetic principles. 
The study of  teleological  mechanisms  (from the  Greek  τέλος or  telos  for  end ,  goal , or  purpose ) in machines with  corrective feedback  dates from as far back as the late 18th century when  James Watt 's steam engine was equipped with a  governor , a centrifugal feedback valve for controlling the speed of the engine.  
Alfred Russel Wallace  identified this as the principle of  evolution  in his famous 1858 paper. 
In 1868  James Clerk Maxwell  published a theoretical article on governors, one of the first to discuss and refine the principles of self-regulating devices.  
Jakob von Uexküll  applied the feedback mechanism via his model of functional cycle ( Funktionskreis ) in order to explain animal behaviour and the origins of meaning in general. 
The early 20th century [ edit ] Contemporary cybernetics began as an interdisciplinary study connecting the fields of control systems,  electrical network theory ,  mechanical engineering ,  logic modeling ,  evolutionary biology  and  neuroscience  in the 1940s. 
Electronic control systems originated with the 1927 work of  Bell Telephone Laboratories  engineer  Harold S. 
Black  on using  negative feedback  to control amplifiers. 
The ideas are also related to the biological work of  Ludwig von Bertalanffy  in General Systems Theory. 
Early applications of negative feedback in electronic circuits included the control of gun mounts and radar antenna during  World War II .  
Jay Forrester , a graduate student at the Servomechanisms Laboratory at MIT during WWII working with  Gordon S. 
Brown  to develop electronic control systems for the U.S. 
Navy, later applied these ideas to social organizations such as corporations and cities as an original organizer of the MIT School of Industrial Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management. 
Forrester is known as the founder of  System Dynamics . 
W. 
Edwards Deming , the  Total Quality Management  guru for whom Japan named its top post-WWII industrial  prize , was an intern at  Bell Telephone Labs  in 1927 and may have been influenced by  network theory . 
Deming made "Understanding Systems" one of the four pillars of what he described as "Profound Knowledge" in his book "The New Economics." 
Numerous papers spearheaded the coalescing of the field. 
In 1935 Russian physiologist  P.K. 
Anokhin  published a book in which the concept of feedback ("back afferentation") was studied. 
The study and mathematical modelling of regulatory processes became a continuing research effort and two key articles were published in 1943. 
These papers were "Behavior, Purpose and Teleology" by  Arturo Rosenblueth , Norbert Wiener, and  Julian Bigelow ; and the paper "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" by  Warren McCulloch  and  Walter Pitts . 
Cybernetics as a discipline was firmly established by  Norbert Wiener ,  McCulloch  and others, such as  W. 
Ross Ashby , mathematician  Alan Turing , and  W. 
Grey Walter . 
Walter was one of the first to build autonomous robots as an aid to the study of animal behaviour. 
Together with the  US  and  UK , an important geographical locus of early cybernetics was  France . 
In the spring of 1947, Wiener was invited to a congress on harmonic analysis, held in  Nancy ,  France . 
The event was organized by the  Bourbaki , a French scientific society, and mathematician  Szolem Mandelbrojt  (1899–1983), uncle of the world-famous mathematician  Benoît Mandelbrot . 
John von Neumann During this stay in France, Wiener received the offer to write a manuscript on the unifying character of this part of applied mathematics, which is found in the study of  Brownian motion  and in telecommunication engineering. 
The following summer, back in the United States, Wiener decided to introduce the neologism cybernetics into his scientific theory. 
The name  cybernetics  was coined to denote the study of "teleological mechanisms" and was popularized through his book  Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine  (MIT Press/John Wiley and Sons, NY, 1948). 
In the UK this became the focus for the  Ratio Club . 
In the early 1940s  John von Neumann , although better known for his work in mathematics and computer science, did contribute a unique and unusual addition to the world of cybernetics:  von Neumann cellular automata , and their logical follow up the  von Neumann Universal Constructor . 
The result of these deceptively simple thought-experiments was the concept of  self replication  which cybernetics adopted as a core concept. 
The concept that the same properties of genetic reproduction applied to social  memes , living cells, and even computer viruses is further proof of the somewhat surprising universality of cybernetic study. 
Wiener popularized the social implications of cybernetics, drawing analogies between automatic systems (such as a regulated steam engine) and human institutions in his best-selling  The Human Use of Human Beings  : Cybernetics and Society  (Houghton-Mifflin, 1950). 
While not the only instance of a research organization focused on cybernetics, the Biological Computer Lab at the University of Illinois, Urbana/Champaign, under the direction of  Heinz von Foerster , was a major center of cybernetic research] for almost 20 years, beginning in 1958. 
Split from artificial intelligence [ edit ] Artificial intelligence  (AI) was founded as a distinct discipline at a 1956 conference. 
After some uneasy coexistence, AI gained funding and prominence. 
Consequently, cybernetic sciences such as the study of  neural networks  were downplayed; the discipline shifted into the world of social sciences and therapy. [ 15 ] Prominent cyberneticians during this period include: Gregory Bateson Aksel Berg New cybernetics [ edit ] In the 1970s,  new cyberneticians  emerged in multiple fields, but especially in  biology . 
The ideas of  Maturana ,  Varela  and  Atlan , according to Jean-Pierre Dupuy (1986) "realized that the cybernetic metaphors of the program upon which molecular biology had been based rendered a conception of the autonomy of the living being impossible. 
Consequently, these thinkers were led to invent a new cybernetics, one more suited to the organizations which mankind discovers in nature - organizations he has not himself invented". [ 16 ]  However, during the 1980s the question of whether the features of this new cybernetics could be applied to social forms of organization remained open to debate. [ 16 ] In  political science ,  Project Cybersyn  attempted to introduce a cybernetically controlled economy during the early 1970s. 
In the 1980s, according to Harries-Jones (1988) "unlike its predecessor, the new cybernetics concerns itself with the interaction of autonomous political  actors  and subgroups, and the practical and reflexive consciousness of the subjects who produce and reproduce the structure of a political community. 
A dominant consideration is that of recursiveness, or self-reference of political action both with regards to the expression of political consciousness and with the ways in which systems build upon themselves". [ 17 ] One characteristic of the emerging new cybernetics considered in that time by  Felix Geyer  and  Hans van der Zouwen , according to Bailey (1994), [ 18 ]  was "that it views information as constructed and reconstructed by an individual interacting with the environment. 
This provides an  epistemological  foundation of science, by viewing it as observer-dependent. 
Another characteristic of the new cybernetics is its contribution towards bridging the  micro-macro gap . 
That is, it links the individual with the society". [ 18 ]  Another characteristic noted was the "transition from classical cybernetics to the new cybernetics [that] involves a transition from classical problems to new problems. 
These shifts in thinking involve, among others, (a) a change from emphasis on the system being steered to the system doing the steering, and the factor which guides the steering decisions.; and (b) new emphasis on communication between several systems which are trying to steer each other". [ 18 ] Recent endeavors into the true focus of cybernetics, systems of control and emergent behavior, by such related fields as  game theory  (the analysis of group interaction),  systems of feedback in evolution , and  metamaterials  (the study of materials with properties beyond the Newtonian properties of their constituent atoms), have led to a revived interest in this increasingly relevant field.

By the time information technology was developed enough to enable feasible  economic planning  based on computers, the Soviet Union and eastern bloc countries began moving away from planning [ 19 ]  and eventually collapsed. 
More recent proposals for socialism involve "New Socialism", outlined by the computer scientists  Paul Cockshott  and Allin Cottrell, where computers determine and manage the flows and allocation of resources among socially-owned enterprises. [ 20 ] Subdivisions of the field [ edit ] Cybernetics is sometimes used as a generic term, which serves as an umbrella for many systems-related scientific fields. 
Basic cybernetics [ edit ] Cybernetics studies systems of control as a concept, attempting to discover the basic principles underlying such things as ASIMO  uses sensors and sophisticated algorithms to avoid obstacles and navigate stairs. 
Artificial intelligence Robotics Computer Vision Control systems Emergence Learning organization New Cybernetics Second-order cybernetics Interactions of Actors Theory Conversation Theory Self-organization in cybernetics In biology [ edit ] Cybernetics in biology is the study of cybernetic systems present in biological organisms, primarily focusing on how animals adapt to their environment, and how information in the form of  genes  is passed from generation to generation. [ 21 ]  There is also a secondary focus on  combining artificial systems with biological systems . [ citation needed ] Bioengineering Biocybernetics Bionics Homeostasis Heterostasis Medical cybernetics Practopoiesis Synthetic Biology Systems Biology Autopoiesis Neuroscience In computer science [ edit ] Computer science directly applies the concepts of cybernetics to the control of devices and the analysis of information. 
Design Patterns Robotics Decision support system Cellular automaton Simulation In engineering [ edit ] Cybernetics in engineering is used to analyze  cascading failures  and  System Accidents , in which the small errors and imperfections in a system can generate disasters. 
Other topics studied include: An  artificial heart , a product of biomedical engineering. 
Adaptive systems Engineering cybernetics Ergonomics Biomedical engineering Systems engineering In management [ edit ] Entrepreneurial cybernetics Management cybernetics Organizational cybernetics Operations research Systems engineering In mathematics [ edit ] Mathematical Cybernetics focuses on the factors of information, interaction of parts in systems, and the structure of systems. 
Dynamical system Control theory Information theory Systems theory In psychology [ edit ] Homunculus Psycho-Cybernetics Cybercognition Systems psychology Perceptual Control Theory Psychovector Analysis Attachment Theory Human-robot interaction Consciousness Embodied cognition Cognitive psychology Mind-body problem Behavioral cybernetics Teorias de la conducta In sociology [ edit ] By examining group behavior through the lens of cybernetics, sociologists can seek the reasons for such spontaneous events as  smart mobs  and  riots , as well as how communities develop rules such as etiquette by consensus without formal discussion [ citation needed ] .  
Affect Control Theory  explains  role  behavior,  emotions , and  labeling theory  in terms of homeostatic maintenance of sentiments associated with cultural categories. 
The most comprehensive attempt ever made in the social sciences to increase cybernetics in a generalized theory of society was made by  Talcott Parsons . 
In this way, cybernetics establishes the basic hierarchy in Parsons'  AGIL paradigm , which is the ordering system-dimension of his  action theory . 
These and other cybernetic models in sociology are reviewed in a book edited by McClelland and Fararo. [ 22 ] Affect Control Theory Memetics [ citation needed ] Sociocybernetics In education [ edit ] A model of cybernetics in Education was introduced by Gihan Sami Soliman; an educational consultant, as a project idea to be implemented with the help of two team members in Sinai. 
The Sinai Sustainability Cybernetics Center announced as a semi-finalist project by MIT annual competition 2013. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ]  The project idea proposed relating education to sustainable development through an IMS project that applies a multiple educational program related to the original natural self-healing system of life on earth. 
Education, sustainable development, social justice disciplines interact in a causal circular relationship that education would contribute to the development of the local community in Sinai village, on both sustainability and social responsibility levels while the community itself provides a unique learning environment that will contribute to the development of the educational program in a closed signaling loop. 
In art [ edit ] Nicolas Schöffer 's  CYSP I  (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic"). [ 27 ]  The artist  Roy Ascott  elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). 
Art historian  Edward A. 
Shanken  has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including " Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s " [ 28 ]  and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott"(2003), [ 29 ]  which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to  telematic art  (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to  net.art .) 
Telematic art Interactive Art Systems art In Earth system science [ edit ] Geocybernetics aims to study and control the complex co-evolution of  ecosphere  and  anthroposphere , [ 30 ]  for example, for dealing with planetary problems such as anthropogenic  global warming . [ 31 ]  Geocybernetics applies a  dynamical systems  perspective to  Earth system analysis . 
It provides a theoretical framework for studying the implications of following different  sustainability paradigms  on co-evolutionary trajectories of the planetary  socio-ecological system  to reveal  attractors  in this system, their stability, resilience and reachability. 
Concepts such as  tipping elements  and  tipping points  in the  climate system ,  planetary boundaries , the  safe operating space for humanity  and proposals for manipulating Earth system dynamics on a global scale such as  geoengineering  have been framed in the language of geocybernetic Earth system analysis.

artificial intelligence was born at a conference at dartmouth in 1956 that was organized by McCarthy, Minsky, rochester, and shannon, three years after the Macy conferences on cybernetics had ended (Boden 2006; McCorduck 1972). 
The two movements coexisted for roughly a de- cade, but by the mid-1960s, the proponents of symbolic ai gained control of national funding conduits and ruthlessly defunded cybernetics research. 
This effectively liquidated the subfields of self-organizing systems, neural networks and adaptive machines, evolutionary programming, biological computation, and bionics for several decades, leaving the workers in management, therapy and the social sciences to carry the torch. i think some of the polemical pushing-and-shoving between first-order control theorists and second-order crowds that i witnessed in subsequent decades was the cumulative result of a shift of funding, membership, and research from the “hard” natural sciences to “soft” socio-psychological interventions

At some future date it may appear as a joke of history that socialist countries learned at long last to overcome their prejudices and to dismantle clumsy planning mechanisms in favour of more effective market elements just at a time when the rise of computers and of cybernetics laid the foundation for greater opportunities in comprehensive planning
